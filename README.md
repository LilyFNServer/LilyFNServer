# LilyFN AIO Server

LilyFN AIO Server is a custom Fortnite backend (written in C# with ASP.NET) and a gameserver (written in C++) connected together through one control panel.

The purpose of this project is to allow users to very easily start their own Old Fortnite Instances and be able to control them without the hassle of going through sketchy websites to download potentially harmful files.
